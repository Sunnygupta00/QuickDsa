#Sorting
1) selection sort : simply calculate the min and swap at last;
2) buble sort : if pair of elements are not in order than swap it i.e arr[i], arr[i+1]
3) insertion Sort : sort starting subArray and place last element in correct manner
4)mergeSort : simply divide and qonquer
5) quick Sort : simply divide and qonquer, but there is pivot element through which we do partition
   
   
   DIFFERENCE BETWEEN QUICK SORT AND MERGE SORT
   1) QUICK SORT IS FASTER THAN MERGE SORT
   Feature	                                Quick Sort	                            Merge Sort
   Time complexity	            O(n log n) average, O(n^2) worst	            O(n log n) average, O(n log n) worst
   Stability	                          Unstable	                                    Stable
   Memory usage	                        O(log n)	                                     O(n)
  Best use case	                           Large arrays	                          Small arrays, arrays that need to be sorted in a stable manner
